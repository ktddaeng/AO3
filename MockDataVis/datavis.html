  <p>Much of new look hasn't exactly changed, except for the lower half. Thankfully the new Twitter has less fancy icons,
    but the added complexity of things like quote retweets basically broke AO3's ability to handle the number of nested
    span elements and images, so I took the janky approach and used emoticons and fancy CSS. This means that mobile and desktop view will vary wildly.
    Also ran into some issues managing the different span containers so I wasn't able to quite get that border line between the reply count
    and the rest of the Tweet to reach the edges. Oh, well, still looks pretty legit, right?</p>

  <p>Much like the Instagram mockup, I have bolded the portions where you should change to personalize the HTML code</p>
