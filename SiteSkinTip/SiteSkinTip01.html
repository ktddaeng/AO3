<p>The next series of chapters will be about site skins, mostly because I'm thinking
of a fun side project: a tool for constructing site skins and lowering the barrier
for the typical AO3 user because I believe in making AO3's features more accessible
to those who aren't tech savvy. It's a step up from my previous project, the
<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/22517134/chapters/53806336">Tweet Skin Builder</a>,
so this will be a great challenge.</p>

<p>There will be many factors to account for, like what tools I need to make this
  tool, and all the elements of an AO3 site skin.
  I guess we call this research? Anyways, I honestly don't know when or if I'll
finish this tool, but I still want to share whatever knowledge I come across.</p>

<p>That said, the next chapters will be semi-documentation on site skins, to
  teach myself and any potential readers. Consider this also a preview
  for the potential features I want to take into account for the project.</p>

<h1>Site Skins Part 1: Metrics</h1>

<p>In this tutorial I will teach you how to hide your metrics, meaning the numbers of
kudos, hits, bookmarks, comments, etc. While there are things
like TamperMonkey scripts and other addons that can accomplish this, you can
actually do this on your own, no extras required.</p>

<h3>Intent</h3>

<p>There is a good reason to hide your metrics from yourself. For me, I get
anxious about how many people have read my fic, and I get easily discouraged looking at
other people's numbers in comparison to my own. Writing fanfiction has always been first
and foremost a hobby for me, and I personally don't want to care how popular my fics are, so I started hiding likes
  and kudos from myself whenever I'm logged in. It's been a few months, and I
think I've felt much more relaxed and free to read and write when I am not
aware of the numbers. That doesn't mean fics should never show metrics, but we
should be allowed the option to see them or not.</p>

<p>I dedicate this tutorial is for those who want a way to make AO3 less
  stressful by not thinking about the numbers.</p>

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>First we must identify what parts we are trying to change in the HTML code
with CSS. Let's examine all the parts of a typical statistics container, which
happens to be a description list (dl).</p>

<p class="tut">
  &lt;dl class="stats"&gt;<br />
  &lt;dt class="language"&gt;Language:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  &lt;dd class="language"&gt;English&lt;/dd&gt;<br />
  &lt;dt class="words"&gt;Words:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  &lt;dd class="words"&gt;69,344&lt;/dd&gt;<br />
  &lt;dt class="chapters"&gt;Chapters:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  &lt;dd class="chapters"&gt;&lt;a href="REDACTED"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;/?&lt;/dd&gt;<br />
  &lt;dt class="comments"&gt;Comments:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  <span>&lt;dd class="comments"&gt;&lt;a href="REDACTED"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;</span><br />
  &lt;dt class="kudos"&gt;Kudos:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  <span>&lt;dd class="kudos"&gt;&lt;a href="REDACTED"&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;</span><br />
  &lt;dt class="bookmarks"&gt;Bookmarks:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  <span>&lt;dd class="bookmarks"&gt;&lt;a href="REDACTED"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;</span><br />
  &lt;dt class="hits"&gt;Hits:&lt;/dt&gt;<br />
  <span>&lt;dd class="hits"&gt;920&lt;/dd&gt;</span><br />
  &lt;/dl&gt;</p>

  <p>There's a lot to take in here, but I've highlighted the important parts in red, or at least
  the parts I believe are the most common anxiety-inducing metrics. Personally,
  I didn't feel much anxiety from comment and bookmark counts, but we will explore hiding
  those features nonetheless.</p>

  <p>Notice how these elements have unique classes and they are also contained
  in description definition tags (dd). This makes selecting these elements
  much easier as we proceed.</p>

  <h3>The Code</h3>

  <p>I assume you have some understanding on how CSS Selectors work. If not,
  I strongly suggest you to look this topic up before beginning any tutorial
  on AO3 site skins.</p>

  <p>To start off, let's learn how to hide hits. We want to select the "hits"
  container containing the number of hits and use CSS to hide its contents. We
  write the CSS rule-set as follows:</p>

  <p class="tut">
    dd.hits{<br />  visibility: hidden;<br />}
  </p>

  <p>See? Very short. Very quick. Very easy. But what's going on here?</p>

  <p>We are selecting all "dd" tags with the class named "hits", then we are
  hiding its contents. Most of you may be more familiar with <span class="tut">display: none</span>
  to hide elements, but as you all know, AO3 is very finicky about what you can
  and cannot change, so this property will not hide the metrics as we want to.</p>

  <p>Instead, we are using the <span class="tut">visibility</span> property. Compared to
  <span class="tut">display</span>, which behaves as if the element was never there in
  the first place, <span class="tut">visibility</span> will still take up space where
  the element should have been.</p>

  <p>Here is a screenshot of what it should look like with hits hidden.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/30/4a/M9PZHYzi_o.png" alt="screenshot of hits hidden"></p>

  <p>As you can see, the number of hits no longer appears when the page loads, but
  because this is using the visibility property, there's a weird blank space instead.
  It's not pretty, but it does the job.</p>

  <p>Now let's try to hide more than one element, because kudos and hits both
  are anxiety inducing for me. You can easily do this by adding selectors to that CSS
  rule-set as follows:</p>

  <p class="tut">
      dd.kudos,<br />dd.hits {<br /> visibility: hidden;<br />}
  </p>

  <p>This is a neat and tidy way to apply similar rules to many types of
  elements at the same time, and in programming, it is very important to avoid
  redundancy. The end result of this new rule-set is this:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/cc/8e/OcwKHV3J_o.png" alt="screenshot of hits and kudos hidden"></p>

  <p>If you want to hide more elements, you can continue to add selectors by separating
  them with commas. Here is template CSS code that hides all potentially
  anxiety-inducing metrics. Simply remove the selectors you do not mind seeing
  and paste it into your site skin.</p>

  <p class="tut">
      dd.comments,<br />
      dd.kudos,<br />
      dd.bookmarks,<br />
      dd.hits {<br /> visibility: hidden;<br />}
  </p>

  <p>This marks the end of the tutorial for now. Thank you for reading this far,
  and I hope those who find this tutorial found this useful.</p>
