    <p>Not everyone has the time, motivation, or leisure to learn how to code,
      much less construct a AO3 skin by hand.</p>

    <p>That's why I built this user-friendly Tweet skin builder
      for the Twitter skin I created. It's a single page interface that lets you
      see your Tweet as you build it. It also generates the HTML you need to display it.
      No coding required.
    </p>

    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Has all the features documented in this work (images, quote retweets, polls, etc.)</li>
    	<li>Easy to use form that works for both mobile and desktop</li>
      <li>Generates HTML code into the fics that will work upon pasting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Limitations:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>You cannot save the tweets you make on the site</li>
      <li>You must provide your own image URLs for any embedded images and avatars.
        Please refer to AO3's suggestions on where to host your own images or google it.</li>
    	<li>The code will not be as neatly organized, and there will be extra span tags.</li>
    </ul>
