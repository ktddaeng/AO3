  <p>"I just wonder, how possible would it be to emulate polls? I can think of
    at least one twitter fic in which the choices the audience made (and the
    percentages of how many people voted for what) contributed to the narrative,
    and many RPers do polls for stuff. Then again I'm mostly thinking from the
    "converting twitter stuff to live forever on the Archive" point of view,
    and I'm not sure if that's what you originally intended."</p>

  <p>The other day, a commenter asked me if it was possible to emulate polls,
    and I got to work trying to answer that question and made this.</p>

  <p>Then I got worried about
    cluttering my work skin from my other guide "Repository" and dealing with
    my old code was a real nightmare, so I decided to make a proper guide to
    properly overhaul the Twitter work skin to a more streamlined, modular
    design with more capabilities. Components like headers, polls, pictures,
    quote retweets are designed to be easily removed and put into the tweet.</p>

  <p>Much like "Repository," this guide aims to use as much pure CSS and HTML
    as possible so users won't have to rely too much on outside sites to render
    icons and whatnot. I hope this work skin and the documentation I've written
    for it will be easy to understand.</p>

    <strong>What You Need</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Although I'll be going through the code piece by piece, this guide is meant
    for beginner coders who have some understanding of HTML and CSS. I don't
    expect you all to be computer wizards starting out, but knowing how to read
    HTML is a very powerful skill to have. If you are really brand new to coding,
    please familiarize yourself with the basics on sites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" rel="nofollow">
    W3 Schools</a>.</p>

  <p></a>You should also be comfortable with setting up your
    own workskin, but if you need to learn that, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370" rel="nofollow">
    AO3 has documentation on how to do this</a>.</p>

  <p>And since we're getting our hands dirty with code, get yourself a proper
    IDE to work in. And don't go trying to edit HTML on your phone. Better to
    be safe than sorry. I personally recommend Atom for something cross platform,
    clean, and lightweight, but any IDE that supports HTML and CSS will do.
    Feel free to leave comments below on recommendations, if you have any.</p>

  <p><strong>Understanding this Guide</strong></p>

  <p>Snippets of code will be written in a different font (namely Courier).
  The specific parts where the user should pay attention to, whether it's for
  customization or a class combination, will be bolded in red as follows</p>

  <p class="tut">&lt;div&gt; Hello my name is &lt;span&gt;
    <span class="red">Cloud</span>
  &lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;</p>

  <p>You will not need to copy paste anything in CSS (stuff with braces), but
  you should try to copy paste with the HTML snippets scattered about. This way
  you will learn how to pick and choose which components you need.</p>

  <p>For quick reference, the HTML templates and complete CSS code dump will
    be placed at the end of this work complete with a changelog in case
    anything has been changed.</p>

  <p><strong>Need Help or Permission?</strong></p>

  <p>Users are free to modify the code to however they like, no need to
    personally ask me, but a credit or two can go a long way.</p>

  <p>As for users who are having trouble with their code, you can either leave a
    comment here, or message me through any of <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/gadaursan/profile" rel="nofollow">my
    listed social media accounts on my profile</a>. Please be as detailed as
    possible about your issue, so sharing code like a Github Gist or a Codepen
    link would be much appreciated.</p>
