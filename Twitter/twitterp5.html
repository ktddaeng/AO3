  <p>In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Night Mode. It's actually
  really really simple. You just add the class <kbd>twNM</kbd> on the outer
  shell, and the CSS does all the work for you.</p>

  <p>Let's do a comparison. First is the Tweet without Night Mode.</p>

  <p>Now we add the class <kbd>twNM</kbd> for Night Mode.</p>

  <p>Notice how the text colors have been automatically inverted. This is because
  the work skin has selectors that will change the color of these elements so
  long as the class <kbd>twNM</kbd> is applied on the outermost part.</p>

  <p>The same applies for polls. While the winning color will stay the same.
  The other options are actually a tad darker than the day mode color.</p>

  <p>Here is the polling Tweet in Day Mode.</p>

  <p>Now for Night Mode.</p>

  <p>And this concludes the tutorial for using Night Mode.</p>
