    <p>Sup, back at it again, but this time with a more updated version of embedded highlightable "Tweets" for your fics.
    In addition to adapting to Twitter's new look as of 2019, I've added some more features such as quote retweeting.
    In case you've never read my stuff before, please refer to the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/8631214/chapters/20890940">previous chapters on the original Twitter mockup.</a></p>

    <h2>Twitter (2019) Simple Embedded Tweet</h2>

    <p>Much of new look hasn't exactly changed, except for the lower half. Thankfully the new Twitter has less fancy icons,
      but the added complexity of things like quote retweets basically broke AO3's ability to handle the number of nested
      span elements and images, so I took the janky approach and used emoticons and fancy CSS. This means that mobile and desktop view will vary wildly.
      Also ran into some issues managing the different span containers so I wasn't able to quite get that border line between the reply count
      and the rest of the Tweet to reach the edges. Oh, well, still looks pretty legit, right?</p>

    <p>Much like the Instagram mockup, I have bolded the portions where you should change to personalize the HTML code</p>
