  <p>This might be the first time you've ever skinned a fic or Ao3, or you just
  want to find a way to code quickly and efficiently. Or you just want links
  for whatever you need.</p>

  <p><strong>Other useful extensions and tools</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Tampermonkey</strong></p>

  <p>While available only on Android as of now, it is possible to install some
  extensions on mobile to improve the reading experience on AO3 without relying
  on third party applications that could potentially charge you money for their
  services. The Mozilla Firefox browser on Android allows Tampermonkey userscripts
  so fandom favorites like Ao3 Savior can be used on Android just as easily as Desktop.</p>

  <p><strong>Offline Reading</strong></p>

  <p>Ao3 has a feature that allows users to read fics offline by downloading fics.</p>

  <p>Calibre is a free software for sprucing up your ebooks</p>
